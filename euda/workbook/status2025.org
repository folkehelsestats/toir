In 2024, approximately src_R[:session kripos]{format(kg2024, big.mark = ",",
scientific = FALSE)} kg of cannabis (resin and herbal/plants) was seized in
Norway, slightly lower than the src_R[:session kripos]{format(kg2023, big.mark =
",", scientific = FALSE)} kg seized in 2023. Figure [[fig:beslag]] shows the number
of seizures for resin, herbal cannabis/plants, and combined cases. Resin
seizures remained relatively stable from 2011 to 2019, followed by a sharp
decline from 2020 onwards. Compared to the peak in 2019, the number of resin
seizures in 2024 was down by src_R[:session kripos :results value raw]{nedResin2019_2024}%. Herbal
cannabis seizures peaked in 2014 and have gradually declined since, but due to
the sharper drop in resin seizures, herbal cannabis now constitutes a relative
larger share of total cannabis seizures.

Figure [[fig:beslagKG]] illustrates the amount of cannabis seized in kilograms. The
total amount seized in 2024 was src_R[:session kripos :results value
raw]{kgStatus2023_2024}% lower than in 2023, but still above the average for the
2011–2021 period. Resin continues to dominate the total volume seized, although
its share has decreased. In 2024, herbal cannabis accounted for src_R[:session
kripos :results value raw]{herbal2024pro}% of the total amount seized—more than
double the share in 2023 (src_R[:session kripos :results value
raw]{herbal2023pro}%). This shift suggests a continued trend toward more
frequent but smaller herbal cannabis seizures, while large resin seizures have
become less common.
